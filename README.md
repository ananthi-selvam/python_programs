In this repository, I have added python programs, which I practiced during my python learning journey.

# 1.Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the **Guess the Number Game**! This is a simple Python program where you try to guess a secret number chosen by the computer.

## How to Play

1. **Enter your name** when prompted.
2. The game will welcome you and ask you to guess a number between 1 and 20.
3. You have **5 attempts** to guess the correct number.
4. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
5. If you guess the number correctly within 5 attempts, you win!
